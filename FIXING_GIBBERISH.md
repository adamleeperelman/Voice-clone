# üé§ Fixing Gibberish Speech in Voice Cloning

## Problem Analysis

**Issue**: The synthesized voice sounds like the right person, but the words are gibberish or unclear.

**Root Cause**: Your training data contains **43.8% problematic samples** with:
- Conversational filler words ("um", "yeah", "buddy", "like")
- Incomplete sentences
- Questions and exclamations
- Unclear pronunciation

This causes the model to learn poor pronunciation patterns, resulting in gibberish output.

## üîç Diagnosis Results

### Training Data Quality:
- ‚úÖ **Good samples**: 14/32 (43.8%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Problematic samples**: 18/32 (56.2%)
- **Status**: MIXED QUALITY (needs improvement)

### Issues Found:
1. **Filler words**: "hey buddy", "yeah", "um", "like"
2. **Conversational speech**: Questions, exclamations, informal tone
3. **Inconsistent quality**: Mix of clear and unclear segments

## ‚úÖ Solutions (In Order of Effectiveness)

### **Solution 1: Use BASE Model (Recommended First Try)** ‚≠ê
**Best for**: Quick fix when fine-tuned model is overfitted

The fine-tuned model learned the gibberish patterns from your training data. The base model doesn't have this problem.

```python
from voice_ai import create_processor

processor = create_processor(workspace_path="voice_clone_project_20251005_203311")

audio = processor.synthesize_speech(
    text="Your text here",
    reference_audio="voice_clone_project_20251005_203311/05_training_data/wavs/main_speaker_004.wav",
    checkpoint_path=None,  # Force base model (no fine-tuning)
    nfe_step=64,
    cfg_strength=3.0,  # Strong guidance for clarity
    reference_text="in terms of the cocoa thing look in the end of the day I got for us over 300,000"
)
```

**Results**: ‚úÖ Generated in `gibberish_fix/test_1.wav`

---

### **Solution 2: Strong Guidance with Fine-tuned Model**
**Best for**: When you want voice similarity + better pronunciation

Increase CFG strength to force clearer pronunciation:

```python
audio = processor.synthesize_speech(
    text="Your text here",
    reference_audio="voice_clone_project_20251005_203311/05_training_data/wavs/main_speaker_004.wav",
    nfe_step=64,
    cfg_strength=4.0,  # Very strong (range: 0.5-5.0)
    reference_text="in terms of the cocoa thing look in the end of the day I got for us over 300,000"
)
```

**Results**: ‚úÖ Generated in `gibberish_fix/test_2.wav`

---

### **Solution 3: Ultra High Quality Settings**
**Best for**: Maximum quality, slower generation

```python
audio = processor.synthesize_speech(
    text="Your text here",
    reference_audio="voice_clone_project_20251005_203311/05_training_data/wavs/main_speaker_004.wav",
    nfe_step=96,  # Ultra high (slower but clearer)
    cfg_strength=2.5,
    reference_text="in terms of the cocoa thing look in the end of the day I got for us over 300,000"
)
```

**Results**: ‚úÖ Generated in `gibberish_fix/test_3.wav`

## üéØ Best Reference Audio Files

Use these **clean samples** for synthesis (avoid the gibberish ones):

| File | Duration | Quality | Text Preview |
|------|----------|---------|--------------|
| `main_speaker_004.wav` | 15.3s | ‚úÖ Excellent | "in terms of the cocoa thing look..." |
| `main_speaker_006.wav` | 18.0s | ‚úÖ Excellent | "It's not appearing as net deposits..." |
| `main_speaker_012.wav` | 9.3s | ‚úÖ Good | "of an experience you actually ever had..." |

## üîß Long-term Solutions

### Option A: Re-train with Better Data
Extract a different time range with clearer speech:

```python
pipeline = VoicePipeline()
pipeline.EXTRACT_START = 15  # Try minutes 15-30
pipeline.EXTRACT_END = 30
pipeline.run_complete_pipeline()
```

### Option B: Use Audiobook/Podcast Audio
- ‚úÖ Professional recordings
- ‚úÖ Clear pronunciation
- ‚úÖ No conversational filler
- ‚ùå May not match your target voice

### Option C: Stricter Filtering
Increase quality thresholds in pipeline:

```python
# In step 5 (voice segments)
min_segment_len = 10.0  # Increase from 8.0
min_duration = 10.0     # Increase from 2.0

# In step 6 (voice activity)
min_voice_ratio = 0.4   # Increase from 0.3
```

## üéß Testing Your Fixes

Run the diagnostic tool:
```bash
python diagnose_gibberish.py
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Analyze your training data quality
2. ‚úÖ Identify problematic samples
3. ‚úÖ Generate 3 test files with different solutions
4. ‚úÖ Show best reference audio to use

**Output location**: `voice_clone_project_20251005_203311/07_generated_audio/gibberish_fix/`

## üí° Quick Reference

### Best Settings for Clear Speech:
```python
processor.synthesize_speech(
    text="Your text",
    checkpoint_path=None,      # Use base model
    nfe_step=64,               # High quality
    cfg_strength=3.0,          # Strong guidance
    reference_text="..."       # Include reference text
)
```

### If Base Model Doesn't Match Voice:
```python
# Use fine-tuned with strong guidance instead
processor.synthesize_speech(
    text="Your text",
    # checkpoint_path auto-detected
    nfe_step=64,
    cfg_strength=4.0,          # Very strong
    reference_text="..."
)
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After applying these fixes, you should hear:
- ‚úÖ Clear, intelligible words (no gibberish)
- ‚úÖ Proper pronunciation
- ‚úÖ Natural prosody
- ‚úÖ Voice similarity (if using fine-tuned model)
